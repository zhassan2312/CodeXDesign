        feedback: "When I brought Zohaib onto the Siemens STR website project, the codebase was a mess — disorganized, slow, and hard to scale. Within days, he had a clear recovery plan. He didn’t just fix bugs; he rebuilt the frontend with React Three Fiber, greatly improved performance, and added custom features that took the 3D experience to the next level. His rare ability to balance creative and technical thinking truly stood out. Highly recommended for anyone needing structure, performance, and precision.",rating: 4.5,

        feedback: "Working with Zohaib has been a game changer for my content. As a YouTuber focused on digital product reviews, I needed someone who could spot UX flaws and redesign interfaces that were clean, modern, and user-friendly. Zohaib did exactly that. From platforms like Reddit, he identified issues, backed his work with solid research, and delivered intuitive redesigns that elevated my videos and helped viewers understand the value of good design. He truly gets the 'why' behind great UX.",
